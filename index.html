                <h2>About Task Manager App</h2>
                <p>You are a junior software developer working on a team project for a tech startup called TechSprint. Your team is developing a new web application for managing project tasks and deadlines. As part of the development process, you are tasked with creating a new repository on GitHub, inviting collaborators, adding some initial files, and then submitting a pull request for review by a senior developer on your team.</p>
                <h3>Here's the step-by-step scenario:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creating the Repository:
                        <p>You log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository named "TaskManagerApp."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Inviting Collaborators:
                        <p>After creating the repository, you invite your team members as collaborators on the project. These collaborators include other developers, a project manager, and a designer who will contribute to the project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Adding Initial Files:
                        <p>Next, you start adding some initial files to the repository. These files include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>README.md: Providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.</li>
                            <li>app.py: The main Python script for the web application.</li>
                            <li>index.html: The HTML template for the application's homepage.</li>
                            <li>style.css: The CSS file for styling the application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generating a Pull Request:
                        <p>Once the initial files are added, you create a new branch called "feature/add-homepage" to work on implementing the homepage of the application. After making the necessary changes in this branch, you push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub and generate a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reviewing the Pull Request:
                        <p>Your PR is assigned to a senior developer on your team for review. The reviewer examines your code changes, checks for any errors or inconsistencies, and provides feedback on improvements or adjustments that may be needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Incorporating Feedback and Merging:
                        <p>After receiving feedback from the reviewer, you make the necessary adjustments to your code based on their suggestions. Once you're satisfied with the changes, you update your pull request and request another review. The reviewer then approves your changes, and you merge your branch into the default branch (usually main or master) of the repository.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Completing the Task:
                        <p>With your changes merged into the default branch, your task is complete. The project now incorporates your contributions, and the team can continue working on other features and improvements for the Task Manager application.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
